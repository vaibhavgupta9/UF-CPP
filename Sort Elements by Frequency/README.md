# Brief Intro
Tags: ___Sorting___

Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. For example, if the input array is `{2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 12, 2, 3, 3, 3, 12}`, then modify the array to `{3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5}`.

If frequencies of two elements are same, print them in increasing order.

__Input:__  
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.


__Output:__  
Print each sorted array in a seperate line. For each array its numbers should be seperated by space.

__Constraints:__
```
1 ≤ T ≤ 70
30 ≤ N ≤ 130
1 ≤ A [ i ] ≤ 60
```

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
