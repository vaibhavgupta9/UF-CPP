## Subsets II
Tags: ___Medium___, ___Backtracking___, ___Array___

Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets.

__Note__: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,
If `nums = [1,2,2]`, a solution is:
```
[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
