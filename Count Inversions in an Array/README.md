# Inversion of Array
Tags: ___Merge Sort___, ___Bit Manipulation___

Given an array, find inversion count of array.

__Inversion Count__ for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.

Formally speaking, two elements `a[i]`` and `a[j]` form an inversion if `a[i] > a[j]` and `i < j`

__Example:__
The sequence `2, 4, 1, 3, 5` has three inversions `(2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3)`.

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
