# Partition Equal Subset Sum
Tags: ___Medium___, ___DP___

Given a __non-empty__ array containing __only positive integers__, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

__Note:__
1. Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
2. The array size will not exceed 200.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```
