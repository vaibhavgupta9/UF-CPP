## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
